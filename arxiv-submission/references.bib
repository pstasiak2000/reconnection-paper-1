abstract = {Quantum vortices are a core element of superfluid dynamics and elusively hold the keys to our understanding of energy dissipation in these systems. We show that we are able to visualize these vortices in the canonical and higher-symmetry case of a stationary rotating superfluid bucket. Using direct visualization, we quantitatively verify Feynman’s rule linking the resulting quantum vortex density to the imposed rotational speed. We make the most of this stable configuration by applying an alternative heat flux aligned with the axis of rotation. Moderate amplitudes led to the observation of collective wave mode propagating along the vortices, and high amplitudes led to quantum vortex interactions. When increasing the heat flux, this ensemble of regimes defines a path toward quantum turbulence in rotating 4He and sets a baseline to consolidate the descriptions of all quantum fluids. Visualization of quantum vortex lattice in stationary, oscillating, and interacting states promises insights on superfluid models.}

abstract = {Quantum turbulence (QT) can appear in the presence of a chaotic tangle of quantized vortices in various quantum-fluid systems, including atomic Bose–Einstein condensates, superfluid helium, superfluid neutron stars, etc. Insights into the generic scaling behaviors of tangled vortices are crucial in developing an advanced statistical model of QT. By tracking tracer particles trapped on vortices in superfluid 4He, we report the observation of an apparent superdiffusion of the vortices in QT. Our analysis shows that this superdiffusion is not due to Lévy flights, i.e., long-distance hops that are responsible for superdiffusion of random walkers. Instead, a power-law scaling of the vortex–velocity correlation is identified as the cause. This finding may motivate extensive future research on hidden scaling laws in QT. Generic scaling laws, such as Kolmogorov’s 5/3 law, are milestone achievements of turbulence research in classical fluids. For quantum fluids such as atomic Bose–Einstein condensates, superfluid helium, and superfluid neutron stars, turbulence can also exist in the presence of a chaotic tangle of evolving quantized vortex lines. However, due to the lack of suitable experimental tools to directly probe the vortex-tangle motion, so far little is known about possible scaling laws that characterize the velocity correlations and trajectory statistics of the vortices in quantum-fluid turbulence, i.e., quantum turbulence (QT). Acquiring such knowledge could greatly benefit the development of advanced statistical models of QT. Here we report an experiment where a tangle of vortices in superfluid 4He are decorated with solidified deuterium tracer particles. Under experimental conditions where these tracers follow the motion of the vortices, we observed an apparent superdiffusion of the vortices. Our analysis shows that this superdiffusion is not due to Lévy flights, i.e., long-distance hops that are known to be responsible for superdiffusion of random walkers. Instead, a previously unknown power-law scaling of the vortex–velocity temporal correlation is uncovered as the cause. This finding may motivate future research on hidden scaling laws in QT.}}

    abstract = "{The dynamics of quantized vortices in superfluids has received increased attention recently because of novel techniques developed to visualize them directly. One of these techniques [G. P. Bewley et al., Nature 441, 588 (2006)] visualized quantized vortices and their reconnections in superfluid flows of 4He by using solid hydrogen tracers of micron-size or larger. The present work improves upon the previous technique by using substantially smaller particles created by injecting atmospheric air diluted in helium gas. These smaller particles are detectable thanks to the higher index of refraction of nitrogen compared to hydrogen and thanks to an improved visualization setup. The optical counting estimate, which agrees with terminal velocity estimates, suggests that the tracer diameter is typically 400 ± 200 nm and could be as small as 200 nm; being smaller, but not so small as to be influenced by thermal motion, the particles get trapped on the vortices faster, perturb the vortices less, possess smaller Stokes drag, and stay trapped on fast-moving vortices, as also on vortices generated closer to the superfluid transition temperature. Unlike the past, the ability to create particles in the superfluid state directly (instead of creating them above the λ-point and cooling the fluid subsequently), ensures greater temperature stability for longer periods, and enables the tracking of long and isolated vortices. These advantages have also led to the direct visualization of Kelvin waves. The use of other seed gases could lead to the visualization of even smaller tracers for quantized vortices. We discuss the visualization setup and provide suggestions for further improvement.}",
