# Punctuated energy injection in superfluid helium-4 vortex reconnections 

LaTeX source code for the paper on superfluid vortex reconnections. In particular focusing on the geometric aspects of the reconnection such as the minimum distance, and the global quantities like normal fluid energy and the energy jumps.

Supplementary material latex source code is included in the file.

The paper is aimed to be submitted to PRL.
