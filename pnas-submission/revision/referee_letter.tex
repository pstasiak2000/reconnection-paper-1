Dear Referees,

\vspace{0.5cm}

We would like to thank the referees reviewing our paper titled
\textbf{``Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality 
in superfluid vortex reconnections''} to be
considerated for publication in \textit{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}. We have taken the time to address the comments, and we note the two major revisions of the manuscript text. Firstly, we have included a short discussion on the relevance of low frequency perturbations in the normal fluid \red{(lines ???-???)} and secondly we have added some details to the introduction to acknowledgements to the generation of Kelvin waves \red{(lines ???-\red???)}, citing some of our previous work on the interactions of Kelvin waves in the normal fluid. Further details are listed in the point to point reponse file.

On behalf of the authors,
