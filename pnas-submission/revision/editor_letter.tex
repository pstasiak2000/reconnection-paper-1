Dear Editor,

\vspace{0.5cm}

We would like to thank the referees for reviewing our article entitled
\textbf{``Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality 
in superfluid vortex reconnections''} to be
considered for publication in \textit{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}. \vspace{0.5cm}

We have addressed all the comments of the referees. We emphasize two major revisions of the manuscript text. Firstly, we have included a short discussion on the relevance of normal fluid finite-amplitude perturbations in the dynamics of superfluid helium (lines 413-429) and, secondly, we have added some details to the introduction in order to highlight the reconnection-driven generation of Kelvin waves (lines 156-162). Further details are listed in the response to the referees.

On behalf of the authors,

\vspace{1cm}

\textbf{Piotr Stasiak}
